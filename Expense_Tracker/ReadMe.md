Developed an Expense Tracker webpage with local storage for storing expenses and providing functionalities like adding, deleting, and editing expenses for financial management.

Local storage is a client-side web storage API that allows data to be stored in a user's web browser. It's ideal for saving user-specific data like expenses without the need for a server or database.

Delete Expense: Users can delete expenses by selecting an expense entry and clicking a "Delete" button, the specific expense data will be removed from local storage, and the UI will be updated to reflect this change.

Edit Expenses: Users can edit expenses if they made a mistake in the details or need to update them.
